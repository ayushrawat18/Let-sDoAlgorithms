# Let-sDoAlgorithms

Repo consists of Datastructures and Algorithms problems. You can find the below solutions for refrence :
The repository is work in progress state, many algorithms are in progress mode. However all the solutions are complete.

1. Sorting Algorithms 
   - Insertion sort 
   - Bubble sort
   - Merge sort
   
2. Search Algorithims
   - Linear Search
   - Binary Search
3. Datastructure usage : Collection API Java
   * Collection of problems solved in :
      - Arrays
      - String 
      - Stack
      - Queue
      - Trees
5. Dynamic Programming 
6. Divide and Conquer : 
      - Maximum sum of a subarray

7. Algorithms
