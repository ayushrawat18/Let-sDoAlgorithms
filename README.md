# Let-sDoAlgorithms

Repo consists of Datastructures and Algorithms problems. You can find the below solutions for refrence :
The repository is work in progress state, many algorithms are in progress mode. However all the solutions are complete.

1. Sorting Algorithms 
   - Insertion sort 
   - Bubble sort
   - Merge sort
   
2. Search Algorithims
   - Linear Search
   - Binary Search
3. Datastructure usage : Collection API Java
   * Collection of problems solved in :
      - Arrays
      - String 
      - Stack
      - Queue
      - Trees
5. Recursion   
   - Do checkout the section of recursion in problem solving. 
   - Try to build all solutions by yourself, contains medium to advanced level of recursion problem. 
   - Check solution for reference. 
6. Dynamic Programming 
7. Divide and Conquer : 
      - Maximum sum of a subarray

8. Algorithms
      - Kadane's



I will keep the above list updated as we move with more and more solutions.
